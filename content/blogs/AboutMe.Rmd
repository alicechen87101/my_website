My name is Alice Chen, I was born and raised in *Taiwan*. My interest in solving and analyzing problems lead to my choice of study statistics in college. I am an outgoing person and loves to meet new friends. Oil painting is my hobby and exploring galleries is my favorite thing to do in my free time. I also love wines and going to bars.
